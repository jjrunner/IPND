        <h3>Important Concepts</h3>

        <h4>How the Web Works</h4>
            <p>
                There are 4 important ideas to keep in mind with regard to the web:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Servers</b> are computers that host the files that make up the web.<br><br>

                    <li><b>Browsers</b> are programs that run on our computer display files found on the web.  Common browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.<br><br>

                    <li>The <b>Internet</b> is the world's largest computer network.  Company's have built search engines to help us parse through the information we want on the Internet.  The largest of these companies is Google. <br><br>

                    <li><b>HTTP</b> is the main protocol of the web.  It is a way for the servers and browsers to communicate with one another. You can think of the Internet as the tubes that connect everything, and HTTP as the way that servers and clients chat with one another across those tubes.
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h4>Basics of HTML</h4>
            <p>
                HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.  This is the main set of text that is used to communicate on the Web.  In this lesson, we focused on a few of the most common tags used in HTML.  These included:

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>&ltb&gt</b> This is the <b>bold</b> tag.<br><br>
                    <li> <b>&ltem&gt</b> This is the <em>italic</em> tag.<br><br>
                    <li> <b>&ltb&gt</b> This is the bold tag.<br><br>
                    <li> <b>&ltimg&gt</b> This is an <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/05/46/63/0546638b58d2d396f97ad69177f104fa.jpg" height="100"> tag, which uses a <em>src</em> attribute.<br><br>
                    <li> <b>&lta&gt</b> This is a tag that allows us link pages together.  For example, I can link to a page of a <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/dogs/">www.animalplanet.com/pets/dogs/</a> using this tag.<br><br>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the tags above, we looked at the difference between <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> elements.  That is, some of these tags take place right within a line, and others create a box around our text.  We didn't get into the details of this, but I am sure we will talk about why we might do one of these versus another in future lessons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final part of of content before tackling this project was all about structuring HTML pages in practice.  That is using <b>&ltbody&gt</b>, <b>&lthead&gt</b>, <b>&lthtml&gt</b>, and <b>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</b> elements.

                Notice that some tags do not require an ending tag.  These are known as <b>void</b> tags.  There are logical reasons for why these tags do not need a closing, which we will see in practice in future lessons, but we already see one of them with inputting images!
